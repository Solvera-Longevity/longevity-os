Important safety note
This workbook is informational and not medical advice.
"Many 'peptides' marketed in wellness/biohacking (e.g., BPC-157, TB-500, AOD-9604) are not FDA‑approved and do not have established safe/efficacious human dosing."
"For FDA‑approved prescription peptides, dosing is summarized from official prescribing information and must be individualized by a licensed clinician."
"If you want, tell me which country you operate in and which peptides you consider 'in scope' (Rx only vs research), and I can tailor the sheet accordingly."
